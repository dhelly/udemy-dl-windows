If you wish to have the files downloaded to a specific location, use the `-o \\path\\to\\directory\\` parameter.\r\n\r\nIf you wish, you can include the username/email and password on the command line using the -u and -p parameters.\r\n\r\n```\r\nudemy-dl.exe -u user@domain.com -p $ecRe7w0rd https://www.udemy.com/COURSE_NAME\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor information about all available parameters, use the `--help` parameter\r\n```\r\nudemy-dl.exe --help\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Advanced Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\nusage: udemy-dl.exe [-h] [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD]\r\n                    [--lecture-start LECTURE_START]\r\n                    [--lecture-end LECTURE_END] [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [-v]\r\n                    link\r\n\r\nFetch all the videos for a udemy course\r\n\r\npositional arguments:\r\n  link                  Link for udemy course\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME\r\n                        Username/Email\r\n  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD\r\n                        Password\r\n  --lecture-start LECTURE_START\r\n                        Lecture to start at (default is 1)\r\n  --lecture-end LECTURE_END\r\n                        Lecture to end at (default is last)\r\n  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR\r\n                        Output directory\r\n  -v, --version         Display the version of udemy-dl and exit\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Upadating\r\n\r\nFor updating components or to latest development version, run `update.cmd` in the same folder of `udemy-dl.exe` and `curl.exe`\r\n\r\n### Downloader \r\nBy default `udemy-dl.exe` uses `aria2c.exe` to download the video file. If it is missing it will try `curl.exe`, and if both these downloaders are missing it will use built in `wget` function. You can delete `area2c.exe` if it is not working or wants to use `curl.exe`.\r\n\r\n### Versioning \r\nThis tool will use  MINOR and PATCH version of <https://github.com/gaganpreet/udemy-dl>, as MAJOR and MINOR versions, and its own changes as PATCH version. Which will be a dirty approach with <http://semver.org/>.\r\n\r\nFor example `v 0.1.8` of `udemy-dl` will be used in `v 1.8.X` of `udemy-dl.exe`.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
