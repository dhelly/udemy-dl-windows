# udemy-dl for Windows
A windows utility to download videos from udemy for personal offline use, based on <https://github.com/gaganpreet/udemy-dl>.

### Usage

Simply call `udemy-dl.exe` with the full URL to the course page.

### Upadating

For updating components or to latest development version, run `update.cmd` in the same folder of `udemy-dl.exe` and `curl.exe`

### Downloader 
By default `udemy-dl.exe` uses `aria2c.exe` to download the video file. If it is missing it will try `curl.exe`, and if both these downloaders are missing it will use built in `wget` function. You can delete `area2c.exe` if it is not working or wants to use `curl.exe`.

### Versioning 
This tool will use  MINOR and PATCH version of <https://github.com/gaganpreet/udemy-dl>, as MAJOR and MINOR versions, and its own changes as PATCH version. Which will be a dirty approach with <http://semver.org/>.

For example `v 0.1.8` of `udemy-dl` will be used in `v 1.8.X` of `udemy-dl.exe`.
